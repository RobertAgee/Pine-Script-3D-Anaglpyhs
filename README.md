'Floaters' is a fun project built in the Pine Script language.  Pine Script is intended for development of technical indicators, but I have co-opted it to create customizable 3D designs.  Floaters supports all 3D glasses types: red/blue, red/cyan, red/green, magenta/green, blue/amber, as well as a few less common variants. It also has a large symbol library to choose from when creating an anaglyph layout.  The symbols can be customizably offset also for your viewing needs.  Finally, there are optional near and distant assist targets for helping the eyes either cross or uncross respectively (cross vs parallel viewing).
